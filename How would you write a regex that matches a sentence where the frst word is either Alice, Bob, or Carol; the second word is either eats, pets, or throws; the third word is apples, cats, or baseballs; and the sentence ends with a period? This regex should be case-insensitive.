How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the frst
word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or
throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends
with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. 
===================================
It must match the
following:
•	 'Alice eats apples.'
•	 'Bob pets cats.'
•	 'Carol throws baseballs.'
•	 'Alice throws Apples.'
•	 'BOB EATS CATS.'
but not the following:
•	 'RoboCop eats apples.'
•	 'ALICE THROWS FOOTBALLS.'
•	 'Carol eats 7 cats.'
===========================

import re
text = 'Alice eats apples.'
pattern = re.compile(r'(Alice|Bob|Carol)\s(eats|pets|throws)\s(apples|cats|baseballs)\.',  re.IGNORECASE)
# (eats|pets|throws)(apples|ats|baseballs \.\s)

match = pattern.search(text)
print(match)
