# Strong Password Detection usinf Pycharm

Write a function that uses regular expressions to make sure the password
string it is passed is strong. A strong password is defned as one that is at
least eight characters long, contains both uppercase and lowercase characters, 
and has at least one digit. You may need to test the string against multiple regex patterns to validate its strength.
=======================================================
import re
print("Enter your password")
password = input()
def checkPassword():
    while len(password) >= 8:
        pattern = re.compile(r'[A-Za-z0-9]*')
        match = pattern.search(password)
        tested_password = match.group()
        message = "password must contain at least 8 characters and  at least one uppercase, one lowercase letter and one digit"

        if tested_password.islower():
            print(message)
            break

        if tested_password.isupper():
            print(message)
            break
        if  tested_password.isdecimal():
            print(message)
            break

        else:
            print("A strong password, well done!")
            break
